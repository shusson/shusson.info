### Improve performance of hierarchical data in postgres with jsonb

There are [various ways](http://patshaughnessy.net/2017/12/11/trying-to-represent-a-tree-structure-using-postgres) of storing hierarchical data in postgres.
However if our hierarchical data represents an [atomic datum](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/datatype-json.html) then we can store the data in postgres as jsonb.
By storing the data as jsonb we can drastically improve the performance of querying the data by avoiding left joins.

An atomic datum is a piece of data that does not need to be split up any further, from the perspective of the database.
The following statements will help determine if your data is atomic.

- the nested data is never queried directly.
- the nested data is never updated in isolation.
- the nested data does not have relationships with any other entities besides it's parent.

Contrived example:

A Library has one or more Books
A Book has one or more Pages.

We could model this in postgres using many to one tables, ie foreign keys on the many side.

```text
Book table (fk to Library)
Page table (fk to book)
```

Querying for a book

```sql
SELECT * FROM book
LEFT JOIN page on page.id = book.id;
```
