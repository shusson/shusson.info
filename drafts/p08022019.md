### Using typescript as a configuration DSL

__08/02/2019__

![](TODO)

Why:

- elasticsearch mapping
- annotations to the mapping
- code generation

Adv:

- It's declarative.
- supports expressions.
- supports merging objects using the spread `...` operator. This enables breaking up large configs files into smaller files.
- supports type constraints.
- serialises to JSON easily.
