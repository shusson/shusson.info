### Interpreting Traceroute results (asymmetric paths)

[Traceroute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceroute) is a CLI tool that lets
you explore the internet from a packets perspective. It lets you see the journey the packet takes from source
to destination. I can only imagine that
that the original tool was a hack (i mean this in the nicest way)
because the [way it works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceroute#Implementation)
sounds like something someone thought about while in the shower one day.

The result of traceroute from a computer in www.cse.unsw.edu.au to www.nyu.com
looks something like this:

Now answer this:

`Between what two routers does the packet cross between Australia and the US?`

Well my immediate guess was hop 8 because the `round trip delay time` (RTT) spikes from 2ms to 145ms.

```bash
 7  et-0-3-0.pe1.bkvl.nsw.aarnet.net.au (113.197.15.147)  2.188 ms  2.284 ms  2.247 ms
 8  xe-0-2-5.bdr1.b.sea.aarnet.net.au (202.158.194.121)  144.248 ms  144.169 ms  144.145 ms
 9  xe-0-6-0-23.r05.sttlwa01.us.bb.gin.ntt.net (198.104.202.61)  145.031 ms  144.646 ms  144.813 ms
```

But something's not right, hop 8 has an Australian domain.
Deeper investigation with `whois` and various geo-location
databases shows that hop 8 is probably in Western Australia and hop 9 is in
the US. So the path looks something like:

But how is it possible that hop 8 has almost the same RTT as hop 9,
which is the hop to America?
Well my best guess is that the reverse path of hop 9 is much faster than hop 8.
Which after some
[googling](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=asymmetric+traceroute&spell=1&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiA4ZG_n8TVAhWKULwKHZbyALAQvwUIJSgA&biw=2560&bih=1295)
I found out is actually one of the common misunderstandings of Traceroute.
Traceroute only shows you the forward path, but the RTT includes the
reverse path. Furthermore asymmetric paths are more likely to happen
around network boundaries. So my guess is the reverse path looks something
like

Is there anyway we can test this conclusion? We could traceroute the reverse path
i.e ssh into an NYU computer and traceroute to UNSW.
Unfortunately I do not access to NYU servers.
