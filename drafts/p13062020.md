### Experiments with postgres analyze

Postgres uses statistics to optimize execution plans for queries. The statistics are gathered by postgres using [ANALYZE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-analyze.html).
These are some experiments to see how much of an effect analyze can have on a tables performance.

But first disable the auto-vacuum daemon which is responsible for automatic analyzing. Be sure to turn this setting back on after testing.

update postgres.conf

```
autovacuum = off
```

and restart postgres.

Verify with settings with

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_settings WHERE name = 'autovacuum';
```

create a test db and some test data (link to previous blog post)
